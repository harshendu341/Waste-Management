# Waste-Management

This was a website our team Skynet consisting of Chandra Pratap Singh Chauhan (@banji7902), Kumar Satwik (developer-metalhead) and Gaurav Khater (theBatman07) created. The website aims to spread awareness about the environment by providing various tips and statistics on waste. The website is integrated with a fully functional chatbot named 'Waste-O-Boy' that not only guides the user through the website but also provides a summary of the information present on the website.
